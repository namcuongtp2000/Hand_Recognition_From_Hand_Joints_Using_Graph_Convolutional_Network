This project follows this below Flow chart:

<img src="/img/flow chart.png" alt="Flow Chart" title="Flow Chart">

# **1. Dataset**

This project using IPN Dataset: https://gibranbenitez.github.io/IPN_Hand/

# **2. Hand joints recognition API**

Using Mediapipe Hands API from Google: https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions

Installation: pip install mediapipe

# **3. Model Architecture**

Replace skeleton input information of whole body into hand joints information to become input for MS-G3D model.

# **5. Issues**

You should modify your real local computer file paths instead of my owns.

This is a test projects and it made a lot of mistakes when can't classify hand gesture labels and recognize exact some hand gestures with short duration.
